# Livesplit-AutoTimers-BOIII

# READ ME
- Make sure you have Steam closed, and that the .exe file for the BOIII client is named just "boiii" in order for the timer to work!
-The timer won't work if these steps are not followed
-I think i've fixed this with the latest version, but seems somewhat inconsistent.

# SETUP:
Open LiveSplit > Right Click > Edit Layout > + > Control > Scriptable Auto Splitter

# Recommendations for AutoSplitter:
-Make sure your LiveSplit is comparing against Game Time and for SubSplits, Splits, Timer, Detailed Timer, Etc... in "Timing Method" I recommend using "Current Timing Method"

-Use SubSplits

-Use Detailed Timer
