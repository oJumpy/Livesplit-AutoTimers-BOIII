# Livesplit-AutoTimers-BOIII's-Client

# Make sure you have Steam closed, and that the .exe file for the BOIII client is named just "boiii" in order for the timer to work!
The timer won't work if these steps are not followed

# SETUP:
Open LiveSplit > Right Click > Edit Layout > + > Control > Scriptable Auto Splitter

# Recommendations for AutoSplitter:
-Make sure your LiveSplit is comparing against Game Time and for SubSplits, Splits, Timer, Detailed Timer, Etc... in "Timing Method" I recommend using "Current Timing Method"

-Use SubSplits

-Use Detailed Timer
