## Custom Layouts
If you are going to make your own layout, make sure your LiveSplit is comparing against `Game Time` for everything. This includes `Subsplits`, `Splits`, `Timer`, `Detailed Timer`, etc.

For `Timing Method`, I recommend using `Current Timing Method`.

## Coming Soon
- Box hit tracker for all maps, I already got all the addresses, just need to apply the logic.

## Credits
- [Scrappy](https://github.com/Joshr520): Previous auto splitter script for coops.
- [Riot](https://twitch.tv/riot) and Chris4a4: Old Game Timer, Round Timer, Reset Timer, and Trap Timer, which served as base for many of the previous scripts.


## Known Issues
> [!CAUTION]
> These are some known issues with the timer, and will be fixed in the future.

### Saving layouts
If you save your layout, with some settings enable you will encounter issues. Example:
- Duplicates Reset options and more.
### Solution
Save your layout only when you first loaded the script or click on `Reset to default` in the bottom right in `Scriptable Auto Splitter`, then save.
I recommend to never save your layout whenever you enable additional settings.
