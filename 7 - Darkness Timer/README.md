# Livesplit-AutoTimers-BOIII's-Client

# SETUP:
Open LiveSplit > Right Click > Edit Layout > + > Control > Scriptable Auto Splitter

# HOW IT WORKS:
Darkness will occur, when the timer hits 58 hours and 6mins ~ (the timer will go faster or slower depending on what fps you are using, so it won't act like real time )
