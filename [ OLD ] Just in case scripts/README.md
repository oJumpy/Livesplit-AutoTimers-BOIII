# Livesplit-AutoTimers-BOIII's-Client

# Make sure you have Steam closed, and that the .exe file for the BOIII client is named just "boiii" in order for the timer to work!
The timer won't work if these steps are not followed

# SETUP:
Open LiveSplit > Right Click > Edit Layout > + > Control > Scriptable Auto Splitter

# Recommendations for AutoSplitter:
-Make sure your LiveSplit is comparing against Game Time and for SubSplits, Splits, Timer, Detailed Timer, Etc... in "Timing Method" I recommend using "Current Timing Method"

-Use SubSplits

-Use Detailed Timer

# HOW DARKNESS TIMER WORKS:
Darkness will occur, when the timer hits 58 hours and 6mins ~ (the timer will go faster or slower depending on what fps you are using, so it won't act like real time )
